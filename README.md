## Disaster Relief System

## Problem Statement
Disasters such as floods and wildfires pose significant challenges to relief and response efforts, often resulting in loss of lives, infrastructure damage, and environmental degradation. Traditional disaster management approaches may lack real-time data and comprehensive analysis, leading to delayed or inefficient response strategies.

## Overview
1. **Data Fusion:** Combine drone, weather, and satellite data for robust analysis.
2. **AI Prediction:** Employ deep learning models like CNN for precise wildfire forecasting.
3. **Optimized Routing:** Refine algorithms for efficient rescue pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm.
